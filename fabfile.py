"""
This is an example fabfile for the fabgis project.

Warning: These are examples and you should always test any proposed
automated deployments thoroughly before trying them on a production server.
I strongly recommend using vagrant for this kind of sandbox testing.

To use this fabfile, you should first install fabric and fabtools. The
requirements file provided in this directory will let you do this easily by
typing e.g.

sudo pip install requirements.txt

To install vagrant, download the latest version from
http://downloads.vagrantup.com/ (use the packages they provide rather than
apt as the ubuntu package is old).

Assuming you are using a vagrant sandbox, you can use the Vagrantfile
supplied with this repo to create your vagrant box. Note that there is a
one time download of around 400mb to add the base image to your boxes
collection. This command will initialise your vagrant sandbox.

vagrant up

Now you are ready to run your first fabgis task! Lets install QGIS master
and PostgreSQL into our vagrant sandbox!

fab vagrant build_server

Now go off and have a cup of tea, when it is done your vagrant box should
have everything set up. If you would like to try out your new QGIS you
could do something like this:

ssh localhost -p 2222 -X /usr/local/qgis-master/bin/qgis

That will run your newly built QGIS instance and forward the display back
to your local X-xerver.
